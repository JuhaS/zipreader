Simple helper for reading zip files with python.

Includes two functions:
 - fileiterator(): Iterates through all files in the zip file returning filename and content for each. 
 - process(): Iterates through all files inside the zip file calling the callback function for each file.

Note: Folders are returned the same as files but they have no content and have trailing slash.

Sample usage:

from zipreader import fileiterator
for filename,content in fileiterator('test.zip'):
  print filename + ": " + content

------------------------

from zipreader import process
def callback(filename, content):
  print filename + ": " + content

process('test.zip', callback)
